# Hungry Snake
2020 ECE243 project
It is a hungry snake game with AI mode. Created based on the FPGA using ARM and C language.

For it to properly run, it needs to work on a ARMv7 DE1-SoC board and all the switch describing below is associated with the board.

# The following is the instruction on how to play this game
1.	To start the game, turn on switch 0, the snake will appear on the screen and the game will start.

2.	If you hit the walls or hit your own body, the game is over and the game over page will show up 

3.	To restart the game, turn off switch 0 then turn on and off switch 2. Now the game is reset, if you turn on switch 0 again, the game will restart. 

4.	To turn on the AI mode, simply turn on the switch 1, our AI will start paying the game for you. Turn off switch 1 to continue playing by yourself 

5.	To control your snake, use the pushbuttons. 0 is for up, 1 for going down, 2 for going right and 3 for going left. The goal is to get as many fruits as possible until you hit the walls or your snake body.
